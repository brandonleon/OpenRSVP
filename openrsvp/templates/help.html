      <h3 class="h5">Creating Events</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Channels are optional—events can stand alone or be grouped inside a <strong>channel</strong>. Pick a channel name that feels unique to your community if you want one.</li>
        <li>Channel options appear as you type; selecting one reuses the existing channel. No login is required.</li>
        <li>Private events remain hidden even when their channel is public.</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="mb-4">
      <h3 class="h5">Public vs Private Channels</h3>
      <p>Channels are lightweight collections of events:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Public channels</strong> show up on the homepage filter and have a public listing under <code>/channel/&lt;slug&gt;</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Private channels</strong> never appear in the UI. Only people with the link can view them at <code>/channel/p/&lt;slug&gt;</code>.</li>
        <li>Private channels do not make private events public—visibility is per-event.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-4">
      <h3 class="h5">Naming Tips & Warnings</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Channel names are converted to slugs: letters are lowercased, accents are stripped to ASCII, and anything besides <code>a-z</code>/<code>0-9</code> turns into a single hyphen (edges trimmed).</li>
        <li>Channel slugs are derived from the name. Using common words like “party” or “friends” increases the odds of collisions.</li>
        <li>We recommend including location or community hints (e.g., “san-diego-cigar-social”).</li>
        <li>Private channels rely purely on the slug—treat them like a shared secret.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-4">
      <h3 class="h5">Safety & Privacy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>No accounts or emails are stored. Keep your magic links private.</li>
        <li>RSVP tokens are shown once after submission—save them if you’ll need to edit later.</li>
        <li>Stale events and channels decay automatically; keep them active by sharing and visiting.</li>
      </ul>
